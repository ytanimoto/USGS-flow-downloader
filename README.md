# USGS-flow-downloader
A simple script to download USGS streamflow data from a gauge station.
User will need to supply the site ID, and the state, and it will do the rest. 

This is useful if you need to download a lot of data for many sites, and will also do some reformatting so that the file is space delimited, instead of tabs!
